nohup: ignoring input
ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  did not find expected key

The error appears to be in '/home/ansibleadmin/ansible_config_files/db_migration/prod/ADRW12PD/mig_vars.yml': line 70, column 33, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

# source coma separated user tablespaces list note: please use uppercase
tablespaces: 'ADAPTDOMAIN1_DATA','ADAPTINTOUCH','ADAPT_DATA','ADAPT_USERS','BOISJMSDB','DHC_ROLLBACK_TRANSIENT','FUZZY_SEARCH','OT_SCHD_DATA','SPMSGBRK_DATA','WEBINT_DATA'
                                ^ here
We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with
unbalanced quotes. If starting a value with a quote, make sure the
line ends with the same set of quotes. For instance this arbitrary
example:

    foo: "bad" "wolf"

Could be written as:

    foo: '"bad" "wolf"'
