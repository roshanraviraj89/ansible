nohup: ignoring input
ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  could not find expected ':'

The error appears to be in '/home/ansibleadmin/ansible_config_files/db_migration/prod/ADRW12PD/mig_vars.yml': line 72, column 1, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


#xtt  parameters
^ here
